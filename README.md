PriceTime.com is powered by <a href="http://datafeedfile.com" target="_blank">DataFeedFile.com</a>, and is intended as an example use of our API and using it to build a mostly complete product search site, used to deliver product shopping data / price comparison shopping data for affiliates. We use typical web <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> services technologies in combination with common data formats such as JSON and XML..

### FAQ / General Howto

- I want to edit the home page or a search result page...how do I do that?
Generally, most modifications can be accomplished by editing the template files inside `/pricetime/application/view`. This folder contains the templates for the home/landing page (home.php), the search result page (search.php), as well as certain sections, such as the left menu (left-menu.php) where the attributes are listed.

### Advanced Information

- PriceTime.com was built off of a well-established, well documented open source framework... <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a>.
- If you wish to just reference the example API wrapper, that is available inside `/pricetime/application/models/api.php`.
